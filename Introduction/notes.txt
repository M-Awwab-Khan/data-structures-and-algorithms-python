1.Data Structure: different ways of organizing data on your computer, that cam be used effectively.
    1.1. Primitive Data Structures:
        - int
        - float
        - str
        - bool
    1.2. Non-Primitive Data Structures:
        1.2.1. Linear DS: arranged in a sequential order:
            - list, tuple, array, linked list, stack, queue
        1.2.2. Non-Linear DS: hierarchical relation
            - set, dictionary, tree, graph
2.Algorithm: set of steps to complete a task
    - in CS: a set of rules for a computer program to accomplish a task
        input data --> calculation --> stop when the answer is found
    2.1. Types of Algorithms:
        - sorting - to sort data in ASC or DESC order
        - search - find a specific value in a data set
        - graph - work with data that can be represented as a graph
        - dynamic programming - to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems
        - divide and conquer - to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems, solving each
            sub-problem independently, and them combining the results
        - recursive - to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems that are similar in nature
3.Quiz:
    3.1. Why do we need DS and algorithms?
        - to develop memory and time efficient applications
    3.2. What is primitive DS?
        - built in DS in any given programming language
    3.3. Please select non-primitive DS.
        - array
    3.4. Which of the following is NOT a linear DS?
        - tree
